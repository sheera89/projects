Robotic hand project utilized two Raspberry Pi 3s, an Arduino Mega, 3-d printed hand, servo motors, haptic feedback sensors, MCP3008 ADC converters, and buzzer motors.

TCP/IP sockets were used to establish two-way communication between the two Pis. The Arduino Mega was used to drive the servo motors as the Raspberry Pi 3 could not provide the requisite current. The robotic glove was fitted with resistive strips which output an analog value depending on the how much the strips have been compressed (bent). The MCP3008 was utilized for its 10-bit ADC converter which took the values from the resistive strips and the haptic feedback sensors (gave a measure of "force" on the fingertips of the robotic hand) and sent the values to the opposite Pi. 

The robotic hand would read the values sent from the robotic glove and send them to the Arduino Mega via the UART at which point the Arduino Mega would parse the input and adjust the servos accordingly. The robotic hand would also read the values from the haptic feedback sensors and send them to the robotic glove Pi via TCP/IP sockets. These values received by the glove were to be scaled to the buzzers and used to actuate them so a person wearing the glove would know if something was touching the robotic hand (due to the haptic feedback force sensors on the fingertips of the robotic hand). This portion of the functionality was not implemented due to a problem with the GPIO pins on the robotic glove.
